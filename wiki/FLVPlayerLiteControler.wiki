= Introduction =

A .mxp is an installation file for Adobe Extension Manager. This command can be used in Flash-IDE after you install it (download and double click it).
It's used to create a default FLVPlayerLite controler which you can easy customize.

For some reason the Adobe Extension Manager want you to restart Flash.
That's not true, I have no idea how to fix this.. But you don't *need* to restart, but of course you always may restart if you feel the need :)
